    Z-score for statistical confidence interval in threshold calculation.

    Uses standard error (SE) based approach to adjust threshold by sample size:
    - SE = sqrt(p * (1-p) / n)
    - gap = z * SE

    Z-score values:
    - 1.0: ~68% confidence (more aggressive, smaller gaps)
    - 1.5: ~87% confidence (balanced, recommended)
    - 1.96: 95% confidence (more conservative, larger gaps)

    Higher sample counts → smaller SE → smaller gap → easier to beat.
    Lower sample counts → larger SE → larger gap → harder to beat.

    Minimum improvement required for later miner to beat earlier miner.

    Ensures that even with very large sample sizes (small SE), there's still
    a minimum gap to prevent noise and random fluctuations from allowing
    copies to beat originals.

    Example: If SE-based gap = 0.01 but MIN_IMPROVEMENT = 0.02,
    the actual gap used will be 0.02.

    Maximum improvement threshold cap.

    Caps the required score gap to prevent unreasonably high thresholds
    when sample size is very small (large SE).

    Example: If SE-based gap = 0.25 but MAX_IMPROVEMENT = 0.10,
    the actual gap used will be capped at 0.10.

    Smoothing epsilon for geometric mean calculation.

    Shifts all scores by +ε before computing geometric mean, then shifts
    back by -ε. This prevents zero scores from collapsing the entire
    geometric mean to 0, which is critical when a new environment is added
    and all miners initially score 0.

    Score range shifts from [0, 1] to [ε, 1+ε].
